# Chart Style Compliance

Generate publication-quality charts following The Economist and Financial Times visual style guidelines.

## Core Principle

Every chart should communicate one clear insight. The title states the finding, not just the data.

## Color Guidelines

### Palette
Use muted, professional colors. The default palette is:

| Role | Color | Hex | Use Case |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| Primary | Economist Blue | `#1A476F` | Main data series |
| Accent | Red | `#C74634` | Highlight key point |
| Secondary 1 | Teal | `#2D7282` | Second category |
| Secondary 2 | Gold | `#E9C46A` | Third category |
| Secondary 3 | Gray | `#5D666F` | Fourth category |
| Background | Off-white | `#F5F5F5` | Chart area |

### Rules
1. Never use rainbow palettes or overly bright colors
2. Highlight only ONE key data point with accent color
3. Use consistent colors for the same category across related charts
4. Never use red and green together (colorblind accessibility)
5. Bars in single-series charts are one color (not gradient)

## Typography

### Title (Required)
Write titles as full sentences that state the insight:
- Good: "China's economy is 70% the size of America's"
- Bad: "GDP by Country"

The title answers "What's the story?" not "What's the data?"

### Subtitle (Optional)
Add context the title doesn't capture:
- "Nominal GDP in US dollars, 2023"
- "Index: 100 = January 2020"

### Labels
- Use sans-serif font (Inter, Helvetica, or system default)
- Axis labels in sentence case, not all caps
- Rotate x-axis labels only if necessary (avoid if possible)
- Data labels on bars/points for charts with ≤8 values

### Source Attribution (Required)
Every chart must include source at bottom:
```
Source: World Bank | Chart: [Your Name/Organization]
```

## Axis Rules

### Bar Charts
- Y-axis MUST start at zero
- No exceptions - truncated bars mislead readers
- Order bars by value (descending) or logically (time, geography)

### Line Charts
- Y-axis can start at non-zero, but show axis break
- For small changes, consider showing percentage change instead
- Connect points with straight lines (no smooth curves)

### General
- Remove top and right spines (chart borders)
- Gridlines should be subtle: light gray (#D0D0D0), optional dashed
- Axis ticks extend inward, not outward
- No redundant labels (if unit is clear, don't repeat)

## Annotations

### Callouts
- Add text annotation pointing to the key insight
- Use arrows or leader lines sparingly
- Annotation text is 1-2 sentences max

### Legends
- Use legend only when >3 categories
- For ≤3 categories, label directly on chart
- Legend goes at top or right, never at bottom

### Data Labels
- Label data points directly when there's room
- Format numbers appropriately (1.2B not 1,200,000,000)
- Remove decimals unless meaningful (1.23% is fine, 1.23B is not)

## Layout

### Aspect Ratio
- Time series: 16:9 (wider than tall)
- Bar charts: 4:3 or 3:2
- Never use square charts for time series

### Margins
- Leave white space around the chart
- Title should have breathing room above
- Source at bottom with clear separation

### Data-Ink Ratio
Maximize data-ink, minimize chartjunk:
- No 3D effects
- No drop shadows
- No decorative elements
- No background images

## Chart Types

### When to Use Bar Chart
- Comparing discrete categories
- Showing ranking
- Part-to-whole (stacked bars)
- Single point in time

### When to Use Line Chart
- Time series
- Continuous data
- Showing trends
- Comparing rates of change

### When to Use Scatter Plot
- Correlation between two variables
- Showing distribution
- Identifying outliers

### Never Use
- Pie charts (use bar charts instead)
- 3D charts (always misleading)
- Area charts (line charts are clearer)

## Output Format

Generate charts as:
1. SVG code (preferred for web)
2. Python matplotlib/altair code
3. D3.js code

Include all styling in the output - the chart should be publication-ready.
